# TowerDefense
Uses pygame.
-includes a lot of math. Need to calculate angle to shoot projectile, shoot it at a speed to hit target (last implementation), program units to follow a path, and basic handling of drag and drop functionality.

#The Basics
Create a tower with a perimeter, made it visual for testing. Towers lock onto creep (term in TD's for the bad guys) and fire their projectile. Creep move and towers shoot! Tower locks onto first creep in the creep array|list.

#Placing Towers
We have shooting towers and moving creep, now we need to be able to place towers on the screen. You can place towers anywhere but on the path and you will see the circle turn red because we can't place it on the path.

#Creep Pathing
Money, each creep gives you money and towers cost money to build now. Creep follow the path and we also have a health bar.

#Prototype functional
Aesthetics are improved with a sidebar with information and towers to click on. Towers still only focus on creep that are first in line.
